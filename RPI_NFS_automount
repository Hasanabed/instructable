To configure NFS access @ RPI:

1) Make sure libraries for NFS are installed on the RPI

2) Set up the share directory and enable NFS on the NAS drive. Verify the mountpoint is available by typing this command on the RPI:
showmount -e 192.168.1.x 
  where 192.168.x is the ip address of the local NAS drive.
3) Edit /etc/fstab and add this line at the end:
192.168.1.x:/volume1/homes /home/pi/NASdrive nfs

4) Use the following command to test if automount is working:
sudo mount -a

5) If the mount -a work, but the RPI is not showing the NFS when rebooting, do this steps:
  sudo raspi-config
  select boot options, wait for network interfaces to initialize
6) test with the "df" command
